# Predicting-house-prices-in-Cameroon
The aim of the present project is to produce a model to predict rent prices in popular neighborhoods in Cameroon. It takes into consideration the two main cities of the country Yaounde and Douala. 
## Data collection
The data collection process is still ongoing. The current dataset is the result of two crawls I made on two websites:
- [Jumia House Cameroon](http://house.jumia.cm/apartment/rent/?page=)
- [Koutchoumi Real Estate](http://www.koutchoumi.com/en/main/showResults?page=)

It contains 3060 observations with features like the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the price etc. The code I used to scrape the data will be provided.

By exploring this dataset, we may find interesting trends.
